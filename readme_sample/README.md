  ## Description
  Fido Facts is a web app that provides facts about dog breeds. Our motivation to create Fido Facts was to help dog lovers wanting to adopt to be able to select the best dog breed to fit their lifestyle and preferences. Fido Facts allows users to visit one website to learn about over 170 dog breeds rather than having to look up each individual breed on a different site.
